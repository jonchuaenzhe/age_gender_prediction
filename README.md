# Age Gender Prediction CNN Model

This project is an implementation of Efficientnet to build a multi-ouput model that can predict the age and gender of the person. It is trained on the IMDB-Wiki dataset (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/) and the AFAD face dataset (https://afad-dataset.github.io/).

The model managed a test gender accuracy of above 95% and a test age MAE of around 5.
